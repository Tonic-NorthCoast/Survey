# Survey
This is my programming challenge.

To run this project firstly do the following:
1.Download it as zip file or easily pull from the repo because it is Public.
2.Create database name it "lifestylesurvey_db" and go to wampserver/Xamp import the databse file from folder named  "MYSQL-DATABASE"
3.Put the downloaded folder in your server folder i.e www or hxttp inside wamp or xamp.
4.got to "http://localhost/survey-lifestyle-system/".
5.then explore the application.
In order to run this application you need a running server to host your database and application.So my advise is : Use WampServer or Xamp.
